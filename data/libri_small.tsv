/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0000.flac	chapter one missus rachel lynde is surprised missus rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow fringed with alders and ladies eardrops and traversed by a brook	14.085
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0002.flac	for not even a brook could run past missus rachel lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum it probably was conscious that missus rachel was sitting at her window keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed from brooks and children up	13.945
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0003.flac	and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it who can attend closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own	14.71
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0004.flac	but missus rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain she was a notable housewife her work was always done and well done she ran the sewing circle	12.515
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0006.flac	as avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond	9.58
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0009.flac	missus rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening before in william j blair's store over at carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon	10.03
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0010.flac	peter had asked him of course for matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life and yet here was matthew cuthbert at half past three on the afternoon of a busy day placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill	14.805
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0011.flac	and his best suit of clothes which was plain proof that he was going out of avonlea and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare which betokened that he was going a considerable distance now where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going there	14.655
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0014.flac	and her afternoon's enjoyment was spoiled i'll just step over to green gables after tea and find out from marilla where he's gone and why the worthy woman finally concluded he doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he never visits	13.96
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0015.flac	if he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to go for more	3.81
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0017.flac	the big rambling orchard embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from lynde's hollow to be sure the long lane made it a good deal further matthew cuthbert's father as shy and silent as his son after him	14.315
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0018.flac	had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead green gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day	11.61
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0020.flac	bordered with wild rose bushes it's no wonder matthew and marilla are both a little odd living away back here by themselves trees aren't much company though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them i'd ruther look at people to be sure	13.415
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0021.flac	they seem contented enough but then i suppose they're used to it a body can get used to anything even to being hanged as the irishman said with this missus rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of green gables very green and neat and precise was that yard	14.81
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0023.flac	one could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt missus rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so the kitchen at green gables was a cheerful apartment	12.15
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0026.flac	and here she sat now knitting and the table behind her was laid for supper missus rachel before she had fairly closed the door	8.335
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0027.flac	there were three plates laid so that marilla must be expecting some one home with matthew to tea but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab apple preserves and one kind of cake so that the expected company could not be any particular company	13.965
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0030.flac	thin woman with angles and without curves her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it she looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience which she was	14.52
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0032.flac	marilla's lips twitched understandingly she had expected missus rachel up she had known that the sight of matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity oh no i'm quite well although i had a bad headache yesterday she said	14.775
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0033.flac	matthew went to bright river we're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in nova scotia and he's coming on the train tonight if marilla had said that matthew had gone to bright river to meet a kangaroo from australia missus rachel could not have been more astonished	14.415
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0036.flac	marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people adopting a boy from an orphan asylum well the world was certainly turning upside down she would be surprised at nothing after this nothing	12.52
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0037.flac	what on earth put such a notion into your head she demanded disapprovingly this had been done without her advice being asked and must perforce be disapproved well we've been thinking about it for some time all winter in fact returned marilla	14.815
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0038.flac	missus alexander spencer was up here one day before christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in hopeton in the spring	7.155
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0039.flac	so matthew and i have talked it over off and on ever since we thought we'd get a boy matthew is getting up in years you know he's sixty and he isn't so spry as he once was his heart troubles him a good deal and you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help	14.425
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0040.flac	there's never anybody to be had but those stupid half grown little french boys and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the states at first matthew suggested getting a home boy but i said no flat to that	14.67
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0041.flac	they may be all right i'm not saying they're not but no london street arabs for me i said give me a native born at least there'll be a risk no matter who we get but i'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born canadian	13.51
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0043.flac	old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper we mean to give him a good home and schooling we had a telegram from missus alexander spencer today the mail man brought it from the station saying they were coming on the five thirty train tonight	14.76
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0046.flac	nor how he's likely to turn out why it was only last week i read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night set it on purpose marilla and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds	13.925
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0047.flac	and i know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it if you had asked my advice in the matter which you didn't do marilla i'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing that's what	12.895
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0048.flac	this job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm marilla she knitted steadily on i don't deny there's something in what you say rachel i've had some qualms myself but matthew was terrible set on it i could see that so i gave in	14.77
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0050.flac	and then nova scotia is right close to the island it isn't as if we were getting him from england or the states he can't be much different from ourselves well i hope it will turn out all right said missus rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts	14.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0052.flac	as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy i'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up i wonder at missus alexander spencer for doing it but there she wouldn't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head	14.79
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0053.flac	missus rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his imported orphan but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert bell's and tell the news it would certainly make a sensation second to none	13.665
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0055.flac	it does really seem as if i must be dreaming well i'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake matthew and marilla don't know anything about children and they'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather	11.245
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0056.flac	it seems uncanny to think of a child at green gables somehow there's never been one there for matthew and marilla were grown up when the new house was built if they ever were children which is hard to believe when one looks at them i wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything	14.315
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1240/103-1240-0057.flac	my but i pity him that's what so said missus rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart	6.855
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0003.flac	he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him he may have been quite right in thinking so for he was an odd looking personage with an ungainly figure and long iron gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders	13.885
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0004.flac	and a full soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty in fact he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty lacking a little of the grayness when he reached bright river there was no sign of any train	14.755
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0005.flac	he thought he was too early so he tied his horse in the yard of the small bright river hotel and went over to the station house the long platform was almost deserted the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end	14.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0009.flac	she's a case i should say i'm not expecting a girl said matthew blankly it's a boy i've come for he should be here missus alexander spencer was to bring him over from nova scotia for me the stationmaster whistled	13.9
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0011.flac	i don't understand said matthew helplessly wishing that marilla was at hand to cope with the situation well you'd better question the girl said the station master carelessly i dare say she'll be able to explain she's got a tongue of her own that's certain	14.485
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0012.flac	maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted he walked jauntily away being hungry and the unfortunate matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den walk up to a girl a strange girl an orphan girl	14.98
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0013.flac	and demand of her why she wasn't a boy matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her she had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now matthew was not looking at her	14.81
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0015.flac	her face was small white and thin also much freckled her mouth was large and so were her eyes which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others so far the ordinary observer an extraordinary observer	14.01
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0016.flac	might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity that the mouth was sweet lipped and expressive that the forehead was broad and full in short our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded	14.665
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0018.flac	i suppose you are mister matthew cuthbert of green gables she said in a peculiarly clear sweet voice i'm very glad to see you i was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me	9.435
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0019.flac	i had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to night	3.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0020.flac	i wouldn't be a bit afraid and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry tree all white with bloom in the moonshine don't you think you could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls couldn't you	9.71
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0025.flac	it's worse than anything you could imagine missus spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that	4.83
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0026.flac	they were good you know the asylum people but there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum only just in the other orphans it was pretty interesting to imagine things about them	11.005
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0027.flac	who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess i used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that because i didn't have time in the day i guess that's why i'm so thin i am dreadful thin ain't i there isn't a pick on my bones	14.88
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0031.flac	i've never seen one but i can imagine what she would look like i don't ever expect to be a bride myself i'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me unless it might be a foreign missionary i suppose a foreign missionary mightn't be very particular	13.1
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0032.flac	but i do hope that some day i shall have a white dress that is my highest ideal of earthly bliss i just love pretty clothes and i've never had a pretty dress in my life that i can remember but of course it's all the more to look forward to isn't it and then	14.005
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0037.flac	oh there are a lot more cherry trees all in bloom this island is the bloomiest place i just love it already and i'm so glad i'm going to live here i've always heard that prince edward island was the prettiest place in the world	12.775
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0038.flac	and i used to imagine i was living here but i never really expected i would it's delightful when your imaginations come true isn't it but those red roads are so funny when we got into the train at charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked missus spencer what made them red	14.935
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0040.flac	there'd be no scope for imagination then would there but am i talking too much people are always telling me i do would you rather i didn't talk if you say so i'll stop i can stop when i make up my mind to it although it's difficult matthew	13.785
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0042.flac	he detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly with sidewise glances as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word that was the avonlea type of well bred little girl but this freckled witch was very different	14.315
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/103/1241/103-1241-0043.flac	and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes	5.73
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0000.flac	chapter ninety nine the law we have seen how quietly	7.875
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0001.flac	the fact being that every one was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness	13.435
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0003.flac	for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection now	14.2200625
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0004.flac	an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother's amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover	9.205
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0005.flac	not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men	10.73
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0006.flac	unfortunately in this world of ours each person views things through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others and madame danglars therefore very much regretted that the marriage of eugenie had not taken place	13.995
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0007.flac	not only because the match was good and likely to insure the happiness of her child but because it would also set her at liberty she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it	13.69
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0009.flac	was ascending the stairs leading to debray's apartments	2.81
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0010.flac	debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him	5.015
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0011.flac	still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugenie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart tea play	13.585
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0012.flac	and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs	4.515
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0013.flac	awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed	8.985
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0015.flac	the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugenie used in leaving it she ran lightly up stairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugenie she was fearful of exciting any remark	14.95
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0017.flac	and had gone to bed and to sleep she called the maid and questioned her mademoiselle eugenie said the maid	6.96
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0018.flac	after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer	3.91
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0020.flac	who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son eugenie she said to herself is lost and so are we the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame	13.945
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0021.flac	for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound	4.685
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0022.flac	and her glance was turned towards heaven	2.54
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0024.flac	and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one	5.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0026.flac	debray could but give her advice she must apply to some one more powerful than he	5.4
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/1034/121119/1034-121119-0027.flac	but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption	13.545
