/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0003.flac	there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained	7.725
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0004.flac	the story's written	2.11
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0005.flac	i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it	5.82
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0006.flac	the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me	4.725

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0013.flac	you'll easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me	5.895

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0016.flac	probably not till the second post	2.03
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0017.flac	it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay	2.695

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0020.flac	who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait for the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more's the pity then	14.355
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0021.flac	won't you tell douglas	2.0
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0022.flac	well if i don't know who she was in love with i know who he was	5.075
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0023.flac	let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give	10.91
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0024.flac	poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth	14.45
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0026.flac	the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun	7.53
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0027.flac	he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed	13.87
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0028.flac	the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time	6.75
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0029.flac	there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority	7.31

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0031.flac	she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness	10.765
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0032.flac	yes but that's just the beauty of her passion	3.17
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0033.flac	it was the beauty of it	2.355
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0034.flac	it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition which was	7.41
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0035.flac	she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded	14.15
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0036.flac	but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked	4.15
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0000.flac	how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child	12.435
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0002.flac	yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension	4.825
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0003.flac	the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best	13.72
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0004.flac	this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life	7.44
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0006.flac	they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind	11.415
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0007.flac	hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity	8.795
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0008.flac	mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge	10.78
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0009.flac	as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment	10.19
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0013.flac	pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world	3.645

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0015.flac	if spoken to she would not speak again	2.63
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0001.flac	another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement	13.43
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0005.flac	it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life	5.865
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0007.flac	but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance	12.77
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0008.flac	come therefore and let us fling mud at them	3.095
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0009.flac	but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight	13.34
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0010.flac	she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them	8.2

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0020.flac	in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it	3.345
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0021.flac	pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery	12.72
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0022.flac	but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening	14.395

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0002.flac	instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid	7.68
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0003.flac	for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived	4.835

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0005.flac	no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone	6.55
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0006.flac	at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins the path divided	6.865
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0007.flac	he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor	6.265

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0009.flac	then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipt	6.285

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0016.flac	the woman seemed thoughtful	2.13
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0017.flac	at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate	10.68
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0018.flac	it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own	12.005

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0021.flac	i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us	9.84
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0022.flac	i'm afraid i don't know much about the land of oz	2.885
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0023.flac	you see i've lived all my life with unc nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything	5.61
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0024.flac	that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in a sympathetic tone	5.26
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0025.flac	i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain	8.705
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0026.flac	but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes	8.29
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0027.flac	yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose	3.27
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0028.flac	a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together	6.045
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0029.flac	sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up	5.335

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0000.flac	ojo examined this curious contrivance with wonder	3.965
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0001.flac	margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout	11.43
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0002.flac	the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her	3.835
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0003.flac	the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids	4.505
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0004.flac	gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable	7.15
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0005.flac	no i forgot all about the brains exclaimed the woman	3.855
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0006.flac	well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work	11.405
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0007.flac	she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles	4.04
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0008.flac	i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant	6.08
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0009.flac	she ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire	5.245

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0011.flac	very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it all together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon	7.75

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0014.flac	presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step	3.405
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0015.flac	will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once in answer	8.415
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0016.flac	we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window	4.37

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0018.flac	the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall	4.6
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0019.flac	at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell	3.78
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0020.flac	will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready	5.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0021.flac	they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs	5.405
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0022.flac	robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him	3.97
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0023.flac	be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly	3.705
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0024.flac	they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission	7.235
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0025.flac	they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit	7.435
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0026.flac	fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him	5.475
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0027.flac	robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground	5.08
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0028.flac	stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault	6.55
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0029.flac	from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's	4.03
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0030.flac	save me masters but you startled me rarely	3.24
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0031.flac	cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him	5.135
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0032.flac	enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him	3.135
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0033.flac	truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair	3.42
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0034.flac	nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh	4.485
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0035.flac	warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by	7.405
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0036.flac	robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them	6.785
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0037.flac	his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them	5.98
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0038.flac	the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest	10.4
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0039.flac	he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands	6.665
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0040.flac	they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell	4.165
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0000.flac	out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree	4.07
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0002.flac	he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries	13.62
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0003.flac	but this was what the tree could not bear to hear	4.76
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0004.flac	in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree	10.25
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0005.flac	oh that made him so angry	3.26
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0006.flac	to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world	13.95
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0007.flac	in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees	6.42

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0012.flac	i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing	7.765

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0017.flac	something better something still grander must follow but what	4.82
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0018.flac	rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight	4.93
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0019.flac	rejoice in thy own fresh youth	4.11
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0020.flac	but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer	8.825
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0021.flac	and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down	4.15
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0023.flac	he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds	9.6950625
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0024.flac	the departure was not at all agreeable	4.13
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0025.flac	the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others	10.69
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0026.flac	there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so	13.96

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0030.flac	perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me	4.575
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0031.flac	it blazed up famously help help	3.98
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0032.flac	cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire	4.0
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0033.flac	a story	1.285
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0034.flac	a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree	5.11
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0035.flac	but i shall tell only one story	2.9

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0038.flac	thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well	8.8
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0039.flac	i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree	4.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0040.flac	and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought	5.125
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0041.flac	in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in	3.88
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0043.flac	what's the meaning of this thought the tree	3.78
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0044.flac	and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie	3.74

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0016.flac	but that is kaffar's knife	2.16

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0018.flac	i remember saying have we been together	2.93
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0019.flac	voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it	3.38
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0020.flac	i say you do know what this means and you must tell us	5.0
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0021.flac	a terrible thought flashed into my mind	3.225
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0022.flac	i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power	4.34
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0023.flac	perchance too kaffar's death might serve him in good stead	4.885
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0024.flac	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me	5.05
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0025.flac	my position was too terrible	2.53

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0027.flac	for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly	3.85

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0001.flac	to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design	11.49
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0002.flac	by reason and affection	2.69
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0005.flac	so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you	8.01
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0006.flac	the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection	11.34
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0007.flac	if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone	12.455
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0008.flac	but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble	11.765
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0009.flac	it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated	12.585
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0000.flac	to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful	11.125
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0001.flac	della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane	5.995

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0007.flac	then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane	6.99
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0009.flac	they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor	3.635
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0010.flac	delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and don't say a word to them	12.025
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0011.flac	so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there	10.315

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0014.flac	and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been	14.175
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0000.flac	nature of the effect produced by early impressions	4.775

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0002.flac	they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood	5.25

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0003.flac	but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws	7.6
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0004.flac	but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface	7.5

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0012.flac	the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised	5.045
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0014.flac	the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface	4.67
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0015.flac	almost instantly he was forced to the top	2.335

/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0018.flac	but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them	10.45
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0019.flac	as he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive's head	5.81
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0020.flac	where the waves for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach	5.415
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0021.flac	but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike	12.605
/home4/khanhnd/LibriSpeech/test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0022.flac	the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived	9.485
