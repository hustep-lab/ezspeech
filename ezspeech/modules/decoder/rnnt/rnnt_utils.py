@dataclass
class Hypothesis:
    """Hypothesis class for beam search algorithms.

    score: A float score obtained from an AbstractRNNTDecoder module's score_hypothesis method.

    y_sequence: Either a sequence of integer ids pointing to some vocabulary, or a packed torch.Tensor
        behaving in the same manner. dtype must be torch.Long in the latter case.

    dec_state: A list (or list of list) of LSTM-RNN decoder states. Can be None.

    text: (Optional) A decoded string after processing via CTC / RNN-T decoding (removing the CTC/RNNT
        `blank` tokens, and optionally merging word-pieces). Should be used as decoded string for
        Word Error Rate calculation.

    timestamp: (Optional) A list of integer indices representing at which index in the decoding
        process did the token appear. Should be of same length as the number of non-blank tokens.

    alignments: (Optional) Represents the CTC / RNNT token alignments as integer tokens along an axis of
        time T (for CTC) or Time x Target (TxU).
        For CTC, represented as a single list of integer indices.
        For RNNT, represented as a dangling list of list of integer indices.
        Outer list represents Time dimension (T), inner list represents Target dimension (U).
        The set of valid indices **includes** the CTC / RNNT blank token in order to represent alignments.

    frame_confidence: (Optional) Represents the CTC / RNNT per-frame confidence scores as token probabilities
        along an axis of time T (for CTC) or Time x Target (TxU).
        For CTC, represented as a single list of float indices.
        For RNNT, represented as a dangling list of list of float indices.
        Outer list represents Time dimension (T), inner list represents Target dimension (U).

    token_confidence: (Optional) Represents the CTC / RNNT per-token confidence scores as token probabilities
        along an axis of Target U.
        Represented as a single list of float indices.

    word_confidence: (Optional) Represents the CTC / RNNT per-word confidence scores as token probabilities
        along an axis of Target U.
        Represented as a single list of float indices.

    length: Represents the length of the sequence (the original length without padding), otherwise
        defaults to 0.

    y: (Unused) A list of torch.Tensors representing the list of hypotheses.

    lm_state: (Unused) A dictionary state cache used by an external Language Model.

    lm_scores: (Unused) Score of the external Language Model.

    ngram_lm_state: (Optional) State of the external n-gram Language Model.

    tokens: (Optional) A list of decoded tokens (can be characters or word-pieces.

    last_token (Optional): A token or batch of tokens which was predicted in the last step.

    last_frame (Optional): Index of the last decoding step hypothesis was updated including blank token prediction.
